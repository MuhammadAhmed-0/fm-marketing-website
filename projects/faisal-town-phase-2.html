      <!-- Introduction -->

        <h3 class="content-heading">Introduction to Faisal Town Phase 2</h3>
        <p>
          Near the Fateh Jang Interchange on the Motorway M-1, on the main Fateh Jang Road, lies a lovely housing
          development called Faisal Town.
          Despite being supposedly located in sector F-18 of Islamabad, it is actually under the control of the
          Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA).
          You can ensure that RDA has authorized its NOC by going to www.rda.gov.pk.<br><br>
          Zedem International Private Limited, a private business initiative of Chaudhry Abdul Majeed (who also happens
          to be the chairman of MPCHS),
          has built a solid reputation in the market thanks to successful projects in E-11, F-17, and B-17, and is the
          owner of Faisal Town.<br><br>
          After proving its brilliance through the first phase, the developers of Faisal Town have now launched Phase 2.
          Plots are available at pre-launch prices. Faisal Town Islamabad is categorized into three blocks: A, B, and C.
          Faisal Town Islamabad Phase-1 has proved to be a highly profitable investment opportunity.
        </p>

      <!-- NOC -->
      <section class="content-section content-section-dark">
        <h3 class="content-heading">Faisal Town Phase 2 – No Objection Certificate (NOC)</h3>
        <p>
          For a housing project to be successful and gain popularity, the concerned development authority must issue a
          NOC.
          The Rawalpindi Development Authority has <strong>not yet authorized</strong> the NOC for Faisal Town Phase
          2.<br><br>
          The good news is that the legitimacy of projects connected to Zedem International can never be questioned.
          Nearly all of Zedem International’s prior projects have received approval from the RDA.<br><br>
          The project’s administration has provided the authority with all necessary documentation.
          Additionally, it has followed all legal procedures to ensure that this housing society is just as real as its
          earlier endeavours.
          This all suggests that Faisal Town Phase 2 will shortly receive its NOC.
