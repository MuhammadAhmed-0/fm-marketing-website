      <h3 class="content-heading">Introduction to Blue World City</h3>
      <p>
        Blue World City is one of the most desired residential societies in Rawalpindi which is constructed and designed
        by the Blue Group of Companies (BGC). Blue Group of Companies is in close collaboration with the world-renowned
        Shan Jian Municipal Engineering Company. Blue World City is strategically built near the Chakri Interchange and
        the newly proposed Rawalpindi Ring Road.<br><br>
        It is one of the top-ranked housing communities in Rawalpindi. Blue World City is currently one of the most
        affordable housing developments and has gained a lot of popularity from investors. Despite its size, it is the
        most cost-effective housing project built by Chinese investors, with a simple and easy payment plan that appeals
        to investors. The fact that it is close to the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi is a benefit.<br><br>
        The project is being built with the intention of becoming Pakistan’s new commercial center. Blue World City will
        be the first residential housing society to be approved as a Pak-China Friendly City. This housing scheme
        project being constructed by Chinese investment would provide a market for Pakistani and Chinese manufacturers
        with easy access to local and international clients via the CPEC route; M-2 Motorway – located near New
        Islamabad International Airport.<br><br>
        Blue World City also offers online services including blue world city verification, online installment, online
        verification of registration certificate, and application status. Because of its central location and
        state-of-the-art infrastructure, the future holds enormous potential for tremendous returns on investments in
        this housing society.<br><br>
        Blue World City is a fantastic option for real estate investors and the general public wishing to buy or build
        their dream house. The most appealing aspect of this project is the reasonable payment plan. People nowadays
        seek a home in an urbanised setting with world-class amenities and natural vegetation.<br><br>
        Blue World City is divided into a few Blocks such as Blue World City General Block, Blue World City Overseas
        Block, Blue World City Blue Hills Country Farms, Blue World City Awami Villas, Blue World Economic Zone, Blue
        World City Orbital Apartments, and Blue World City Awami Residential Complex.<br><br>
        <span class="content-highlight">
          Awami Residential Complex in Blue World City is currently one of the most affordable housing projects in the
          district. Awami Residential Complex has become fairly popular with investors and those searching for a property
          on a budget and a reasonable payment schedule providing an ideal alternative for investors who are looking for
          a high return on investment ratio.

    <!-- NOC -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-dark">
      <h3 class="content-heading">Blue World City – No Objection Certificate – NOC</h3>
      <p>
        Initially, the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) approved Blue World City Rawalpindi in the Preliminary
        Planning Permission for around 427 Kanal of land. Later on, the No Objection Certificate (NOC) of Blue World
        City society status from the RDA was added to the list of under-processing societies after a new application was
        filed.<br><br>
        The District Council, in Letter No. 532/10/DC dated 07-08-2018, issued a letter regarding Blue World City’s NOC.
        After signing the 2021 Local Bodies Ordinance by Governor Punjab, the government addressed the jurisdictional
        disagreement between the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) and the District. The District Council will have
        to approve all residential housing societies under this Ordinance.<br><br>
        After all of this debate, Blue World City was awarded final approval, resulting in a rise in plot prices shortly.
        The Blue World City’s NOC is undergoing another round of approval. The owners are optimistic that the housing
        society’s NOC will be approved soon.<br><br>
        <span class="content-highlight-dark">
          However, due to its progress and development, there is a good likelihood that Blue World City will soon be a
          fully legalized housing society by RDA. The NOC of any residential project is deemed extremely crucial to all
          the people interested and affected by it because after the NOC has been received the project is considered
          legalized which fosters trust in the community and its developers.

        Shan Jian Municipal Engineering Company, a globally recognized Chinese firm, to ensure that the promise of
        world-class development is delivered in Pakistan.
      </p>
      <h4 class="content-heading" style="font-size:1.3rem;">Blue Group of Companies</h4>
      <p>
        The Blue Group of Companies was founded in Lahore in 1989. Initially, the company offered architectural design
        and construction services. By attracting the attention of clients and respectable investors in the industry, the

        printing. The company has also started a retail operation in addition to these services. It also has a number of

        This housing project will be a wonder of Chinese development and architecture. Not only is it the most
        affordable housing society in the area it is also specifically planned to meet the need to accommodate the

      <p>
        Blue World City Islamabad is situated in a relatively remote place and for so long this area has been neglected
        and the connections for electricity, gas, and water are rarely granted. Although it was a hard task, the
        employees worked around the clock and endlessly to facilitate the investors and to provide them with the
        necessities of life including 24/7 availability of gas, electricity, and water so the citizens of this society
        can enjoy a stress-free life.

        Blue Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey is a marvel of classical architecture built between the years 1609 by Muslim
        designers and architects who have inspired the planners of the Blue World City to build a replica of this

    <!-- Latest Development & Pak-China Friendly City -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-light">
      <h3 class="content-heading">Latest Development in Blue World City</h3>
      <p>
        Even though the society has not been officially launched yet, the development work in the project has begun. The
        construction work of the grand entrance of the society is near completion, the construction of the main
        boulevard of the society is in process. The land clearing process in phase 1 of society has commenced and it
        will not be long before the mapping and leveling of plots will begin. In a recent development, the CEO of Blue
        World City Saad Nazeer held a meeting with Mr. Chang, a top Chinese multi-floor apartment building developer for
        the construction of apartment buildings at Blue World City Islamabad.
      </p>

      <h3 class="content-heading">Blue World City Pak-China Friendly City</h3>
      <p>
        The management of this housing project has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Shan Jian Municipal
        Engineering Company, a leading development, and investment company based in China for the development and
        investment of this mega-housing project and to make it a successful Pak-China friendly venture. Let us discuss
        some reasons as to why this housing society will be monumental in strengthening the relationship between the two
        countries and becoming the first Pak-China friendly City.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Development of Chinese and Pakistani residents</strong>: This housing society will be developed using
          Chinese skills & technology along with the help of professionals from Pakistan. The standard of maintenance
          and development of this society will match all the international standards of living. The society will also
          cater to all the provisions including commercial and economic zones, residential areas, education, health
          institutes & entertainment clubs, making this housing society “A Pak-China Friendly Society”.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pak-China Investment</strong>: The Shan Jian Municipal Engineering Company has joined hands with Blue
          Group of Companies to share the investment of this remarkable housing scheme, thus making this a joint venture,
          not just two companies but between two countries, thus making it a Pak-China friendly city in a true sense.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CPEC Route Proximity</strong>: The location of the CPEC Route is very close to Blue World City
          Islamabad, it is a joint venture between Pakistan and China to improve the trade between the two countries.
          Since the majority of the workers will be Chinese and will need a secure nearby accommodation, it will provide
          excellent accommodation to satisfy and meet their requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chinese Architecture and Development</strong>: The infrastructure of society will be developed using
          Chinese techniques and construction. The master plan of the society and the architectural design will be
          inspired by the modern architecture of the cities in China. Thus making it a marvel of China–Pakistan
          friendship.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accommodation for Chinese Residents</strong>: A large inflow of Chinese residents will move to
          Pakistan in the next few years due to the CPEC project. This housing project will also be developed by Chinese
          workers and is expected to receive over 10,000 Chinese residents for construction and development work. A
          specially designed block has been reserved for Chinese residents in the society under conditional ownership.
          Blue World City Islamabad is the very first Pak-China friendly City to be built in Pakistan which will benefit
          both the countries economically and socially. This society will not just bring citizens of China and Pakistan
          closer, it will also present endless commercial and residential opportunities for its occupants. The venture
          will also promote harmony and peace in the region and will encourage foreign investment in the country.
